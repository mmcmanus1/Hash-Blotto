    greed(City)

A greedy construction heuristic solution: Greedily maximize
the distance/time ratio of the next junction. Reward is scaled down by 
2 * repetitions of a street [if more than once] to discourage repeated edges

------------------------------------------------------------------------
We improve on the prior work of the HashCode2014 package (https://github.com/gdalle/HashCode2014.jl)
by designing and implementing a greedy heuristic
