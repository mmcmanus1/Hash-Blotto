    greed(City)

function that is greedy in it's approach to finding the best path,
the logic it follows is looking at the distance/time ratio of the
next junction and choosing the one with the highest ratio, if a car
has already gone down one of the roads then we will calculate the reward
based off of reward/ 2 * times it has gone down the road


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building off of the HashCode2014 package (https://github.com/gdalle/HashCode2014.jl) that 
was already built out for us, I definetly made it better as it is smarter in how
    it chooses paths than (https://github.com/gdalle/HashCode2014.jl/blob/main/src/random_walk.jl)
