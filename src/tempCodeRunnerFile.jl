#     greed(City)

# function that is greedy in it's approach to finding the best path,
# the logic it follows is looking at the distance/time ratio of the
# next junction and choosing the one with the highest ratio, if a car
# has already gone down one of the roads then we will calculate the reward
# based off of reward/ 2 * times it has gone down the road


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Building off of the HashCode2014 package (https://github.com/gdalle/HashCode2014.jl) that 
# was already built out for us, I definetly made it better as it is smarter in how
#     it chooses paths than (https://github.com/gdalle/HashCode2014.jl/blob/main/src/random_walk.jl)
