# HashBlotto's Algorithm for Google Hash Code 2014

## Introduction
The Google Hash Code 2014 competition was 

HashBlotto used a greedy algorithm that used a Depth First Search-esque algorithm to find the best possible move. 

## The Problem

Will talk about the problem in general

## The Algorithm

I'll go into depth about our greedy appraoch algorithm here

## The Results

I'll go into depth about how after we came up with the algorithm I implemented a distribution function to find the best possible penalty factor for the algorithm


## Analysis of Upper Bound

Analysis of the Upper Bound will go here

## Unexplored / Unfinished Ideas for Improvement

Talk about how I looked into adding a reward where I would look at the potential next nodes adjacent steets and looked to see if we had been down those streets before. 

Talk about how I looked into recreating Kruskal's algorithm, but instead of creating it to
